Scripts behind the figures for our paper on the role of a knockout in a key receptor that mediates defenses against herbivory in Phaseolus vulgaris.

In the interest of transparency, these scripts were created in order to replicate the fantastic visual work of Figure 2 from Espina et al., 2024 (10.1111/tpj.17026)
These are by no means perfect, but it accomplished the same goal.
